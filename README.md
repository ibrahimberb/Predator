[Predator](https://github.com/abu-compbio/Predator/) is a computational tool that offers both 
the prediction of mutation effects on protein-protein interactions by classifying them 
into disrupting and nondisrupting and provides a comprehensive analysis on candidate cancer 
associated genes, their most frequently disrupted interaction partners, cancer patients and 
several cancer cohorts in TCGA project.

## Reproducibility
Below are the steps to obtain the results in the paper.

### Preparing the _Predator_ environment
1. Download the repository and move to the _reproducible_ folder.\
``cd \Predator\src\reproducible``


2. Update the conda base\
``conda update conda -n base -y``


3. _conda-forge_ needs to be added for installations of packages.
``conda config --append channels conda-forge``


4. Create a new environment named _predator_ with a specified Python version and install required packages.\
``conda create python=3.8.13 --name predator --file requirements.txt -y``


5. Activate new environment.\
``conda activate predator``


6. Adding _ipykernel_ to this new environment named _Predator_.
``python -m ipykernel install --user --name predator --display-name "Predator"``


### Training the _Predator_
The trained model can be found in [here](https://github.com/abu-compbio/Predator/tree/main/src/PredatorModels/PredatorModel_2022-06-16/cc84a54e). In order to train from scratch, 
please execute the following command:

``python reproducable_01_training_predator.py``

Newly trained model will be extracted in 
_src\PredatorModels\PredatorModel\_<date\>\\\<hash>_ directory. Additionally, a new executed
Jupyter notebook _Reproduced_PredatorStudyModel.ipynb_ will be created in _reproducible_ folder.

### Predictions on the TCGA Mutation Datasets

Trained Predator model can be applied to TCGA mutation datasets with 
_reproducable_01_training_predator.py_. The script also allows the selection of 
the model to be used in the prediction task. Simply run the following command to execute:

``python reproducable_02_predicting_tcga.py``

This will export prediction files in _predictions_datasets_ folder and 
create _Reproduced\_PredatorStudy\_<TCGA\>\.ipynb_ for each TCGA cohort.

### Patient Interaction Analysis

If the path of prediction files are not to be updated, the patient interaction analysis 
files are generated by the following command:

``python reproducable_03_patient_interaction_analysis.py``

The paths of newer prediction datasets can be updated in the script before running it.
Upon completion, Excel files containing interactions and patients for each TCGA should
appear in _data/patient_interaction_datasets_ folder. Also, _Reproduced_Disruptive_patients_per_patient.ipynb_
will be created in executed form.

### Analysis

Lastly, update the path if necessary in _reproducible_04_analysis.py_ and run it
with the command below:

``python reproducible_04_analysis.py``

Execution of this command will create counts file for each TCGA.

Run the first part of the notebook _tables/preliminary_tables_counts.ipynb_ as indicated.

Run the notebook _analyses/PatientInteractionAnalysis/PatientInteractionAnalysis.ipynb_.

Continue with the second part of the _tables/preliminary_tables_counts.ipynb_, which
the Gene Level Statistics table will be generated.
